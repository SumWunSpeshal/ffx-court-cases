- styling
- add hint when "new case" form is already in an ongoing process. Maybe even open dialog to correct form step on page load.
- more and better component extraction
- not satisfied with how tightly coupled the `form` components are
- "Success"-page should be a toast message instead of its own form step.
- better routing for form progression steps. Currently just tied to control flow (if/else). Maybe even use URL params?
- form validation. Currently only checks property presence and truthiness of value (except `isFinished` of course).
- txt file validation
- loading states
- better error handling (also tightly coupled currently)
- obviously the txt file parsing is garbage at the moment (very brittle, lots of assumptions about the data, bunch of loops)
- better download functionality instead of imperatively creating DOM nodes
- didn't really pay attention to rerenders. I'm sure there are some `useMemo()'s` and `useCallbacks()'s` that could be used
